Neural Style Transfer (CPU) — Implementation Guide
1) Environment & Project Skeleton

Implement

Create a clean Python environment (CPU-only).

Turn off GPU usage (e.g., set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 before running).

Folders:

data/content/
data/style/
outputs/runs/
outputs/plots/
metrics/


One main entry (notebook or script) that drives everything via a small config block (paths, size, steps, α/β/γ, seed).

Verify

Import TF successfully; create empty folders; print your config at start of run.

Pitfalls

Randomness: set a global seed (Python/NumPy/TF) for reproducibility.

Mixed images sizes/aspect: decide to square-resize (simplest) or center-crop first.

2) Image I/O & Preprocessing (Deterministic)

Implement

Loader that:

Reads an image, converts to float32 in [0,1].

Resizes to a square (256, 384, 512).

Adds a batch dimension to make it (1, H, W, 3).

Saver that:

Clips to [0,1], removes batch dim, writes PNG.

Verify

Round-trip: load → save → visually inspect no channel swaps (RGB).

Pitfalls

Accidentally normalizing twice; verify values are in [0,1] before/after.

3) Encoder: VGG-19 Feature Taps (Frozen)

Implement

Load VGG-19 (no classification head, ImageNet weights).

Freeze weights.

Choose layers:

Content: block5_conv2

Style: block1_conv1 … block5_conv1 (five taps)

Build a small model that, for an input image, returns:

A dict of style activations (one per chosen style layer)

A dict of content activations (for content layer)

Verify

One forward pass returns (a) Gram-ready style features, (b) content features with expected shapes.

Print layer names once to confirm no typos.

Pitfalls

Forgetting VGG’s preprocessing (mean-center/scale). Apply it right before the VGG forward.

4) Style Representation: Gram Matrices

Implement

For each style layer activation (1, H, W, C):

Reshape spatial dims into one axis and compute Gram (feature correlations).

Normalize by H*W so scales are comparable across sizes.

Verify

Gram output shape is (1, C, C) per layer.

Re-running on the same image yields identical values (seeded & frozen net).

Pitfalls

Forgetting to divide by spatial size → style loss scale explodes with resolution.

5) Loss Functions (Make them Inspectable)

Implement

Content loss: mean-squared error between current content features and target content features.

Style loss: average MSE across the five Gram matrices (current vs style targets).

Total Variation (TV) loss: standard smoothness prior on the image.

Total loss = α * content + β * style + γ * TV.

Verify

Log each component loss every N steps (e.g., 25): they should be finite and trending down overall.

Try extreme weights (very small/very large β) to see predictable behavior.

Pitfalls

TV weight too high → overly smooth, washed-out results.

Units: don’t compare raw loss magnitudes across different image sizes without noting the scale.

6) Optimization Loop (Adam on the Image)

Implement

Create a trainable image variable, initialized from the content image (most stable).

Each step:

Forward through feature extractor.

Compute losses.

Compute gradients wrt the image variable.

Apply Adam update with a modest learning rate (e.g., 0.02).

Clip image back to [0,1] after the step.

Early stopping

Start checking after a threshold step (e.g., 300 for 512px).

If relative loss improvement < 0.5% since last check → stop.

Verify

Loss decreases over time; the image visually stylizes.

Changing seed produces the same result (if you fixed all seeds).

Pitfalls

Optimizing the network by mistake. Only the image should be trainable.

Too large LR → noisy artifacts and divergence.

7) Checkpointing & Naming (Auditability)

Implement

Save a PNG every N steps (e.g., 50) plus a final image.

Filename encodes settings:

{content}__{style}__{size}px_{steps}s_a{α}_b{β}_tv{γ}_lr{lr}_seed{seed}__step050.png


Keep runs under outputs/runs/.

Verify

You can sort files by name and reconstruct exactly how an image was produced.

Pitfalls

Overwriting runs; ensure filenames are deterministic and unique per config.

8) Logging & Metrics (CSV First)

Implement

Append one line per run to metrics/metrics.csv with:

timestamp, content filename, style filename

size, steps, α, β, γ, lr, seed

final total loss, wall-time (s)

SSIM vs content (optional but nice)

final image filename

Verify

After a run, CSV contains a new row with correct parameters and paths.

Pitfalls

Locale issues (commas in decimals) if you open CSV in Excel; stick to . and UTF-8.

9) Sanity Tests (Quick Wins)

Implement/Run

Tiny smoke test: 256px, steps≈50, β=1000 → should stylize without exploding.

Beta sweep at 384px: β ∈ {1000, 2000, 5000} with fixed α, γ.

Resolution check: same pair at 256/384/512 to confirm behavior and runtime scaling.

Verify

Loss goes down; images look increasingly stylized as β increases.

512px is slower; early-stopping trims the tail.

Pitfalls

Comparing SSIM across resolutions; keep size fixed when comparing metrics.

10) Batch Runner (Parameter Grid)

Implement

A simple loop (or notebook cell) that:

Iterates over a set of content×style pairs (e.g., 6×6 for 36 runs).

Iterates β presets (e.g., 1000/2000/5000) at 384px.

Calls your single-run function for each combo.

Add a minimal progress print and try/except to continue on errors.

Verify

metrics.csv grows deterministically; output folders contain complete sets.

Pitfalls

File I/O bottlenecks: avoid recomputing style/content targets inside the inner loop if the pair doesn’t change.

11) Portfolio & Gallery (512px)

Implement

Pick your preferred β (often around 2000 for balance).

Run your best 36 pairs at 512px with early-stop.

Assemble a 6×6 gallery image (titles/captions optional) for the report.

Verify

Gallery is sharp, diverse, and filenames encode settings.

Pitfalls

Memory spikes at 512px; close figures and free variables between runs.

12) Analysis Plots (From CSV)

Implement

Read metrics.csv into a dataframe.

Produce:

SSIM vs β (per pair or averaged) to show plateau behavior.

Runtime vs size and runtime vs β summaries.

Save plots to outputs/plots/.

Verify

Plots match your qualitative observation (e.g., diminishing returns at high β).

Pitfalls

Mixing different content/style pairs without labeling; include legends or facet by pair.
